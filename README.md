# Chess
---
This project is not only to create a working game of Chess, but to hone disciplined skills:
* Version Control
* Testing
* Code Modularity
* CI/CD pipelining

## Workflow
1) Create a board
2) Check inputs to track which tile is clicked
   * if a tile has a piece, select that piece
     * Display possible moves for the piece (Strategy pattern)
